== Installation Requirements

Since relm is based on GTK+, you need this library on your system in order to use it.

See http://gtk-rs.org/docs-src/requirements[this page] for information on how to install GTK+.

== Usage

Create a new project with `cargo new` and add this to your
`Cargo.toml` under the `[dependencies]` group:

[source,toml]
----
gtk = "0.7.0"
relm = "0.18.0"
relm-derive = "0.18.0"
----

Next, add these imports to the file `src/main.rs`:

[source,rust]
----
use gtk::prelude::*;
use gtk::{Inhibit, Orientation::Vertical};

use relm::Widget;
use relm_derive::{Msg, widget};
----

Then, create your model:

[source,rust]
----
pub struct Model {
    counter: i32,
}
----

The model contains the data related to a `Widget`. It may be updated by the `Widget::update` function.

Now, create your message `enum`:

[source,rust]
----
#[derive(Msg)]
pub enum Msg {
    Decrement,
    Increment,
    Quit,
}
----

Messages are sent to `Widget::update` to indicate that an event happened. The model can be updated when an event is received.

It is time to create the widget itself.
We'll start by implementing the `model()` method which provides the
initial value of the model:

[source,rust]
----
#[widget]
impl Widget for Win {
    fn model() -> Model {
        Model {
            counter: 0,
        }
    }
----

Next, we'll create the view:

[source,rust]
----
    view! {
        gtk::Window {
            gtk::Box {
                orientation: Vertical,
                gtk::Button {
                    clicked => Msg::Increment,
                    label: "+",
                },
                gtk::Label {
                    text: &self.model.counter.to_string(),
                },
                gtk::Button {
                    clicked => Msg::Decrement,
                    label: "-",
                },
            },
            delete_event(_, _) => (Msg::Quit, Inhibit(false)),
        }
    }
----

This code describe the view.
There's a lot going on here:
the root widget is a `gtk::Window` and contains a `gtk::Box`, which
contains `gtk::Button`s and a `gtk::Label`.
The most important for now is how we declare properties, connect
events and create bindings.

In the button, we set the value of a property to a static value:

[source,rust]
----
gtk::Button {
    label: "+",
}
----

This is equivalent to doing the following in plain `gtk-rs`:

[source,rust]
----
button.set_label("+");
----

In the same button, we connect an event to send a message:

[source,rust]
----
gtk::Button {
    clicked => Msg::Increment,
}
----

This means that whenever the button is clicked, the message
`Msg::Increment` will be sent to the `update()` method.

Also, we create a binding between a property and a model field:

[source,rust]
----
gtk::Label {
    text: &self.model.counter.to_string(),
}
----

This means that whenever the `counter` attribute is updated, the text
of the label will be updated as well.

Finally, we'll implement the `update()` method:

[source,rust]
----
    fn update(&mut self, event: Msg) {
        match event {
            Msg::Decrement => self.model.counter -= 1,
            Msg::Increment => self.model.counter += 1,
            Msg::Quit => gtk::main_quit(),
        }
    }
}
----

The `#[widget]` attribute will change this code so that assignment to
model fields will also update the view.

We're now ready to launch this application:

[source,rust]
----
fn main() {
    Win::run(()).unwrap();
}
----

Run this program with `cargo run` and you'll see a window where
clicking on buttons will change the counter you see in it.

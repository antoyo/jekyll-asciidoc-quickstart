:page-navtitle: Relm now has better error messages!

Relm is an attempt to do an idiomatic GUI library in Rust, based on gtk+.
See the https://antoyo.github.io/jekyll-relm-blog/relm-intro[introduction article] for details about why this library was created and how to use it.

== New release

I've just released relm version 0.12!

This new release does not provide a bunch of new features, but fix a very important issue:
the bad error messages.

Before this release, the error message were not really helpful:

[source,rust]
----
error[E0308]: mismatched types
  --> examples/buttons-attribute.rs:57:1
   |
57 | #[widget]
   | ^^^^^^^^^
   | |
   | expected &str, found struct `std::string::String`
   | help: consider borrowing here: `&#[widget]`
   |
   = note: expected type `&str`
              found type `std::string::String`
----
_What a funny help message from the compiler!_

Now, the error is shown exactly where it should be:

[source,rust]
----
error[E0308]: mismatched types
  --> examples/buttons-attribute.rs:89:27
   |
89 |                     text: self.model.counter.to_string(),
   |                           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   |                           |
   |                           expected &str, found struct `std::string::String`
   |                           help: consider borrowing here: `&self.model.counter.to_string()`
   |
   = note: expected type `&str`
              found type `std::string::String`
----

Which is now helpful, to say the least.

*This only works when using nightly and when using these features:*
[source,toml]
----
[features]
default = ["relm/unstable", "relm-attributes/unstable", "relm-derive/unstable"]
----

== Other fix

This release also fixes another https://github.com/antoyo/relm/commit/35c0f28a7647c4637fe33763f0f0a00aec3d54e0[issue] where it was impossible to set child properties in some cases.

== Conclusion

I hope that the people who didn't want to use relm because of the bad error messages will now give it a try.
As always, your feedback is very much appreciated.
Also, there are https://github.com/antoyo/relm/issues[issues] that could use some love and many of them are tagged as https://github.com/antoyo/relm/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aeasy[easy] if you wish to start with something simple.
Don't wait to make a difference in the Rust ecosystem!
